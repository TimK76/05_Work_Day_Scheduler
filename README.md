## Description 
    This was a class project that used HTML CSS, bootsrap, jQuery, and Moment.js (despite being depricated) to make a simple scheduling app for the basic workdays. It has the current day/date at the top and just the workday hours of 9-5 with text areas for tasks that persist upon page refresh.

    I was given the following User Story and Acceptance Criteria and some starter code. 

## [Starter Code] (https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/super-disco)

## User Story

    AS AN employee with a busy schedule
    I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
    SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria

    GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
    WHEN I open the planner
    THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
    WHEN I scroll down
    THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
    WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
    THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
    WHEN I click into a time block
    THEN I can enter an event
    WHEN I click the save button for that time block
    THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
    WHEN I refresh the page
    THEN the saved events persist
